LeBron James, Goat James, Villain James, Flopping James, LeCap, whether you love him or have a strong dislike for him (he happens to be my favorite athlete), you can't ignore the faat that he is a larger than life figure who has transformed how we view sports. The man is the closest example to the perfect athlete. His play is mesmerising. LeBron James is 2nd to none, he has defied father time, still dominating the NBA in his 40s, his career has outlasted those who came far after him. LeBron has had the best career in the history of sports, which is why I think that the 2026-2027 season should be his last.
