After months of [Trae Young buzz](https://chkbm.github.io/chkpage//posts/2025/12/defending-trae-young-trade-value/), ranging from positive to what some, such as myself, would consider to be outright hostile and unfounded, he was finally [traded](https://www.spotrac.com/news/_/id/3212/wizards-acquire-trae-young-from-hawks-for-cj-mcollum-corey-kispert) to the Washington Wizards.



Hawks Received:       Corey Kispert, CJ McCollum  
Wizards Received:   Trae Young

## My Assesment of the Trade
- Essentially a salary dump
- The best worst-case scenario as far as return is concerned
- Amicable conclusion for both Trae and the Hawks


The Ramifications
=====
While [CJ McCollum](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/player/_/id/13323/cj-mccollum) and [Corey Kispert](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/player/_/id/74122/corey-kispert) aren't stellar players, their situations are a better fit for the Hawks plans, McCollum is 34 years old, and, while he averaged a quality 18.8 points with the Wizards this season, and 21.1 points with the Pelicans last season, you can't ignore the fact that he is a great guy to have in the locker room, also on the last year of his contract, will be an unrestricted free agent this summer. In the era of the 2nd apron, I expect CJ McCollum to receive less than $30M/Year. As far as Corey Kispert is concerned, he's reliable from behind the arc, shooting a career average 38% from three.
