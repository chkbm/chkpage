After months of [Trae Young buzz](https://chkbm.github.io/chkpage//posts/2025/12/defending-trae-young-trade-value/), ranging from positive to what some, such as myself, would consider to be outright hostile and unfounded, he was finally traded to the Washington Wizards.



Hawks Received:       Corey Kispert, CJ McCollum  
Wizards Received:   Trae Young

## My Assesment of the Trade
- Essentially a salary dump
- The best worst-case scenario as far as return is concerned
- Amicable conclusion for both Trae and the Hawks
