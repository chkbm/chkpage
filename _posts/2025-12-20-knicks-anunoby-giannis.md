When the New York Knicks signed OG Anunoby to a 5-year, $212 million contract, they didn't just secure an elite two-way wing—they fundamentally altered their path to acquiring Giannis Antetokounmpo.

The Financial Reality
======

The OG Anunoby deal represents more than just a significant financial commitment. At $42.4 million per year, it's a statement that the Knicks are building around their current core rather than preserving maximum cap flexibility for a potential Giannis pursuit in 2026 or beyond.

With Jalen Brunson's contract, KAT's hefty salary, and Anunoby's massive deal, the Knicks have effectively locked themselves into their current trajectory. The financial gymnastics required to create the cap space for a Giannis max contract would require dismantling the very team they've been carefully constructing.

Why This Matters for Giannis
======

Giannis Antetokounmpo represents the holy grail of NBA free agency. A two-time MVP, Finals MVP, and one of the most dominant forces in basketball, he's exactly the type of superstar that could transform the Knicks from contenders to champions. But landing him requires more than just hope—it requires cap space, assets, and timing. It's well known that he desires to play in the Big Apple.

The Anunoby signing suggests the Knicks have made their choice: build a competitive team now rather than wait for a superstar who may never become available.

The Trade Scenario Problem
------

Could the Knicks still trade for Giannis? Theoretically, yes. But the math becomes incredibly complicated. They'd need to match salaries, which likely means including Anunoby himself in any deal—defeating the purpose of signing him in the first place. The Bucks would also demand a king's ransom in draft picks, and the Knicks have already traded away significant future assets in their pursuit of win-now moves.

It will be difficult to find a team that is willing to have OG Anunoby's contract on their payroll, especially with the 2nd apron.

The Silver Lining
======

Here's the counterargument: maybe signing OG Anunoby *is* the path to Giannis. If the Knicks can build a legitimate contender with their current core, they become a more attractive destination for stars looking to join a ready-made championship team. Giannis might be more inclined to force his way to a proven winner than to a team banking everything on his arrival.

Additionally, Anunoby's defensive versatility and three-point shooting make him exactly the type of player who could complement Giannis if the stars somehow aligned. He's not a ball-dominant player, and his contract, while large, wouldn't be impossible to work around in a trade scenario if the Bucks were willing to take back significant salary.

The Verdict
======

The reality is that the Knicks have chosen their path. The OG Anunoby contract is a commitment to winning now with this core, not preserving flexibility for a hypothetical future. Whether that's the right decision depends on how far this team can go—and whether Giannis ever becomes available at all.

For Knicks fans dreaming of Giannis in orange and blue, the dream isn't dead, but it's certainly on life support. The front office has placed their bet, and only time will tell if it pays off.
