Over the past year and a half or so, the [Golden State Warriors](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors) have been in a period of uncertainty, ever since the departure of longtime [Splash Brother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splash_Brothers) Klay Thompson to the Dallas Mavericks in the summer of 2024, the Warriors have been dealing with increased inner turmoil. At the center of that turmoil is the young player named [Jonathan Kuminga](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4433247/jonathan-kuminga).




## The Cold Hard Truth
Star player Steph Curry, arguably the best point guard to ever play the game will be 38 in less than 2 months. While he is still playing at a phenomenal level, he won't play forever, I anticipate that he will be done by the summer of 2027 or 2028, as he indicated [serious doubt](https://www.nbcsportsbayarea.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/lebron-james-steph-curry/1892811/) that he'll suit up for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, in a recent podcast. 

That means that the Warriors have to get serious about their outlook after Steph, the Warriors don't seem too keen on the younger players on their roster, Jordan Poole was traded away after the [situation](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/39610127/golden-state-warriors-draymond-green-jordan-poole-line) with Draymond Green, who is causing quite a stir as usual. Brandin Podziemski, who was inserted into the starting lineup, in place of Klay Thompson in his last season is now back to coming off the bench. Meanwhile, Jonathan Kumings has been receiving multiple DNP'S.
